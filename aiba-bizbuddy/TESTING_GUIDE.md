# 🧪 AIBA Testing Guide - New Features

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Advanced Prompt Parser** (`src/utils/promptParser.js`)
- Extracts structured data from natural language input
- Supports customer names, products with qty/rate/UOM, GST, transport, payment terms
- High-confidence parsing with validation
- Training data with 10+ example patterns

### 2. **Central State Manager** (`src/utils/chatbotStateManager.js`)
- Prevents state clashes between different conversation modes
- Tracks current intent (idle, quotation_intent, checklist_mode, etc.)
- Maintains conversation context and history
- Smart routing based on current state

### 3. **Suggestion System** (`src/utils/suggestionManager.js`)
- Contextual autocomplete for customer names and products
- Recent customers and popular steel products
- Smart UOM suggestions based on product type
- Rate suggestions from historical data

### 4. **Suggestion UI Component** (`src/components/SuggestionBox.jsx`)
- Floating suggestion box below input field
- Shows recent customers, popular products, and contextual suggestions
- Visual confidence indicators and metadata

## 🧪 Test Cases to Verify

### **Test 1: Quick Quotation with High Confidence**
**Input:** `Quote to ABC Constructions: ISMB 150 - 45 Nos @ ₹75 + GST`

**Expected Result:**
- Should be parsed immediately with high confidence
- Should show "Smart Quotation Generated!" message
- Should display structured quotation with PDF buttons
- Check browser console for parsing logs

### **Test 2: Complex Multi-Product Quote**
**Input:** `Quote for Swastik Industries: TMT 10mm - 5MT @ ₹55/kg, ISMB 150 - 2nos @ ₹8000. GST 12%. Transport: Extra. Loading: Rs.250/MT`

**Expected Result:**
- Should extract 2 products correctly
- Should capture GST as 12%
- Should identify transport and loading terms
- High confidence parsing

### **Test 3: State Management Verification**
1. Start a quotation process
2. Try sending unrelated messages
3. Check if system maintains quotation context
4. Verify no jumping to default/home messages

### **Test 4: Fallback to Guided Mode**
**Input:** `Create quotation for XYZ Company`

**Expected Result:**
- Low confidence parsing (missing products)
- Should fallback to guided checklist mode
- Should ask for product details step by step

## 🔍 Browser Console Testing

### **Check Console Logs:**
```
🧠 PromptParser: Processing input: [your input]
🧹 PromptParser: Cleaned text: [cleaned input]
✅ PromptParser: Final result: {customerName, productsCount, confidence, gst}
🧠 State Manager: Current state: {intent, step, awaiting, hasQuotationDraft}
🎯 State Manager: Routing decision: {action, intent, step}
```

### **Confidence Thresholds:**
- **90-100%**: Perfect parsing, direct PDF generation
- **70-89%**: Good parsing, show preview for confirmation
- **50-69%**: Partial parsing, ask for missing details
- **0-49%**: Poor parsing, fallback to guided mode

## 📝 Training Data Verification

The system includes 10 training samples in `training-data/samples.json`:

1. Complex multi-product with GST
2. TMT bars with payment terms
3. Steel products with transport/loading
4. Multiple items with different UOMs
5. Price validity and terms
6. Various customer formats (M/s, Ltd, etc.)
7. Different rate structures (per kg, per MT, per piece)

## 🚀 Integration Points

### **1. ChatBot Integration:**
- New prompt parser integrated in `handleSend()` function
- State manager routing before existing flow
- High-confidence results bypass old parsing

### **2. Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ `hybridParseQuotation` function error resolved
- ✅ Import paths updated to use new utilities
- ✅ Data structure compatibility ensured

### **3. Enhanced Flow:**
```
User Input → State Manager Routing → Prompt Parser (if quotation) → 
High Confidence? → Direct Quotation : Guided Mode
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### **✅ Working Correctly:**
- Console shows parsing logs with confidence scores
- Quick quotations generate immediately for complete inputs
- State management prevents conversation jumping
- Fallback to guided mode for incomplete inputs

### **❌ Needs Attention:**
- No console logs (parser not loading)
- All inputs fallback to guided mode (parsing failing)
- State jumping between conversation modes
- Errors about missing functions

## 🔧 Debugging Tips

### **If Parser Not Working:**
1. Check browser console for import errors
2. Verify training data loads (may show "Training data not available")
3. Check if `promptParser` object exists in console

### **If State Management Issues:**
1. Look for state manager console logs
2. Check if routing decisions are appropriate
3. Verify conversation context preservation

### **Test Commands in Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Test prompt parser directly
promptParser.parsePromptToQuote("Quote to ABC: TMT 10mm - 5MT @ ₹55")

// Check state manager
chatbotStateManager.getStateSummary()

// Test suggestions
suggestionManager.getSuggestions({currentField: 'customerName'}, 'ABC')
```

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Parse Time:** < 100ms for typical inputs
- **Confidence:** 80%+ for well-structured quotes
- **Success Rate:** 90%+ for training data patterns
- **Fallback Rate:** < 30% to guided mode

---

**🎯 Quick Test Summary:**
1. Try: `Quote to ABC Steel: TMT 10mm - 5MT @ ₹52 + GST`
2. Check console for parsing logs
3. Verify immediate quotation generation
4. Test with incomplete input to see fallback

All changes are **backwards compatible** - existing functionality remains intact while new features enhance the experience.
