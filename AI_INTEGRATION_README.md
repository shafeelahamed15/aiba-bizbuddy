# 🤖 AIBA AI Integration Guide

## 🚀 **Phase 1: AI-Powered Field Extraction**

AIBA has been enhanced with OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent quotation processing. The system now uses advanced AI to understand natural language inputs and extract business information automatically.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Before (Rule-Based)**
```
User Input → Regex Patterns → Basic Extraction → Manual Processing
```

### **After (AI-Powered)**
```
User Input → GPT-4 Analysis → Intelligent Extraction → Automated Processing
```

---

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install openai==1.50.2
```

### **2. Configure OpenAI API Key**
Add your OpenAI API key to your `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

### **3. Test the Integration**
```bash
python test_ai_integration.py
```

---

## 🧠 **AI Components**

### **1. QuoteBrain Class (`quote_brain.py`)**
The main AI engine that handles:
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Interprets user requests in plain English
- **Field Extraction**: Automatically identifies customer names, quantities, rates, etc.
- **Steel Industry Knowledge**: Built-in understanding of ISMC, ISMB, MT conversions
- **Calculation Engine**: Automatic GST and total calculations
- **Fallback System**: Regex backup if AI fails

### **2. AI-Powered Functions**

#### **`extract_quote_fields(user_input, context="")`**
```python
# Example Usage
result = extract_quote_fields("Quote for ABC Company - 5 MT ISMC 100x50 at ₹56/kg")

# Returns structured data:
{
    "success": true,
    "customer_name": "ABC Company",
    "material_description": "ISMC 100x50 (5 MT)",
    "quantity": 5000,
    "original_unit": "5 MT",
    "rate": 56.0,
    "amount": 280000.0,
    "gst_amount": 50400.0,
    "grand_total": 330400.0,
    "missing_fields": ["address", "gstin", "email"],
    "confidence": 0.95
}
```

#### **`detect_intent(user_input)`**
```python
# Automatically detects user intentions
detect_intent("Quote for ABC Company")  # Returns: "quotation"
detect_intent("I need a purchase order")  # Returns: "purchase_order"
detect_intent("Hello there!")  # Returns: "greeting"
```

## 🎯 **AI Capabilities**

### **✅ What the AI Can Do**

1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - "Quote for ABC Company - 5 MT ISMC 100x50 at ₹56/kg"
   - "Need quotation for XYZ Ltd - 10 tons steel angles"
   - "Price quote for 2000 kg ISMB 150 at ₹45 per kg"

2. **Automatic Unit Conversion**
   - 5 MT → 5000 kg
   - 10 TON → 10000 kg
   - Preserves original units for display

3. **Steel Industry Knowledge**
   - Recognizes ISMC, ISMB, angles, plates
   - Understands standard steel specifications
   - Knows typical weight calculations

4. **Automatic Calculations**
   - Amount = Quantity × Rate
   - GST = Amount × 18%
   - Grand Total = Amount + GST

5. **Missing Field Detection**
   - Identifies what information is missing
   - Prompts for customer address, GSTIN, email
   - Handles incomplete inputs gracefully

### **🔄 Fallback System**
If AI extraction fails, the system automatically falls back to:
- Basic regex pattern matching
- Manual field collection
- User-guided input process

---

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

### **AI Model Configuration**
- **Model**: GPT-4 (for extraction) / GPT-3.5-turbo (for intent)
- **Temperature**: 0.2 (for consistent results)
- **Max Tokens**: 1000
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0 - 1.0

### **Expected Performance**
- **Accuracy**: 90-95% for well-formatted inputs
- **Speed**: 2-5 seconds per extraction
- **Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per quotation
- **Fallback Rate**: <5% for typical steel industry inputs

---

## 🛠️ **Integration Points**

### **Modified Files**
1. **`quote_brain.py`** - New AI engine
2. **`app.py`** - Updated to use AI functions
3. **`requirements.txt`** - Added OpenAI dependency

### **Key Changes in Flask App**
```python
# OLD: Rule-based extraction
extracted_data = prompt_parser.extract_quotation_data(message)

# NEW: AI-powered extraction
extracted_data = extract_quote_fields(message, context)
```

---

## 🔍 **Testing Examples**

### **Test Inputs**
```python
test_cases = [
    "Quote for ABC Company - 5 MT ISMC 100x50 at ₹56/kg",
    "Need quotation for XYZ Ltd - 10 tons steel angles",
    "Price quote for 2000 kg ISMB 150 at ₹45 per kg",
    "Quotation for DEF Industries - 3.5 MT ISMC 125 @ Rs.52/kg",
    "Quote for GHI Corp: 8000 kg steel plates at ₹48 per kg"
]
```

### **Expected AI Outputs**
- ✅ Customer names extracted correctly
- ✅ Quantities converted to kg automatically
- ✅ Rates identified and standardized
- ✅ Calculations performed accurately
- ✅ Missing fields detected properly

## 🚨 **Error Handling**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **API Key Missing**
   ```
   Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not found
   Solution: Add API key to .env file
   ```

2. **API Rate Limits**
   ```
   Error: Rate limit exceeded
   Solution: Implement retry logic or upgrade API plan
   ```

3. **JSON Parsing Errors**
   ```
   Error: Invalid JSON response
   Solution: AI automatically falls back to regex
   ```

4. **Network Issues**
   ```
   Error: Connection timeout
   Solution: System uses cached fallback extraction
   ```
