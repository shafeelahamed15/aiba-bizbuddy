✅ **Session Management**: Same session handling and redirects  
✅ **User Experience**: Identical UI and navigation  

## 🏗️ New Architecture

### **Firestore Collections Structure**

```
📁 users/
   └── {email} → user authentication data
   
📁 user_profiles/  
   └── {user_id} → business profiles with bank info
   
📁 customers/
   └── {user_id}_{customer_name} → saved customer data
   
📁 chat_sessions/
   └── {session_id} → active chat conversations
   
📁 quotations/
   └── {quote_id} → generated quotations
   
📁 purchase_orders/
   └── {po_id} → purchase order documents
```

### **Data Isolation & Security**
- ✅ **User-specific data**: Each user can only access their own data
- ✅ **Secure by design**: Firestore security rules enforce data isolation  
- ✅ **Scalable**: Supports thousands of concurrent users

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Files Updated**
1. **`firestore_service.py`** - New comprehensive Firestore service layer
2. **`auth_firestore.py`** - Firestore-backed authentication manager  
3. **`chat_memory_firestore.py`** - Firestore-backed chat memory
4. **`auth.py`** - Updated to delegate to Firestore auth manager
5. **`models/memory.py`** - Updated to delegate to Firestore memory
6. **`migrate_to_firestore.py`** - Migration script (completed successfully)
